Together, they explored the nooks and crannies of Numeria, unearthing hidden mathematical treasures. Through their adventures, Professor Euler demonstrated the art of finding the best approximation to a real number, using rational numbers in reduced form.\n\nAs Alice's knowledge grew, so did the complexity of her questions. One evening, as the sun set over Numeria, she posed a puzzling query to Professor Euler: \"Why do some numbers possess two best approximations for a given denominator bound?\"\n\nA flicker of recognition crossed Professor Euler's face as he realized the significance of Alice's question. The answer to her query held the key to unlocking the enigma of ambiguous numbers. Determined, he explained how ambiguous numbers challenge conventional mathematical norms, evoking a sense of intrigue and mystery.\n\nDays turned into nights, and puzzles piled up on their desks.

However, their favorite game for the past few months had been Nim, a simple game involving three heaps of stones.\n\nEvery day after school, Alice and Bob would gather at the park, where they would arrange three heaps of stones. They would then take turns removing any number of stones from a single heap. The one who was left with the final stone(s) was declared the winner. It was a game of strategy, wit, and a little bit of luck.\n\nBut as the days went by, Alice and Bob started to grow tired of the same old three-heap Nim. They wanted to make it more exciting, more challenging. And so, they came up with a brilliant idea that would take their game to a whole new level.\n\nThey decided to add an extra rule - they must not make two heaps of the same size. This meant that they had to be extremely careful with their moves, as they couldn't simply empty one heap completely or distribute stones equally among the heaps. It required them to think even more strategically, calculating their every move.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Alice and Bob sat in the park, ready for their first game of the new version. As they began to play, they quickly realized how difficult it was to come up with winning strategies. Every move had to be carefully calculated, taking into consideration not only their own immediate advantage but also their opponent's possible moves.\n\nAfter playing for a while, they discovered something intriguing.

Four other distinct circles, which we call \"planets\", with circumferences p, p, q, q centimetres respectively (p<q), are inscribed within C but outside S, with each planet touching both C and S tangentially. The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of S and C must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.\nNow suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. C is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that c, s, p, q are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.\nNote that \"perfectly meshing\" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa.

The villagers often sought her out to solve their intricate numerical conundrums, and she relished the challenge each problem brought.\n\nOne sunny day, as Lily was strolling through the bustling marketplace, she noticed a peculiar commotion. A group of townsfolk had gathered around a magnificent structure that stood proudly in the center of the square. It was an enormous clock tower, with gears and cogs intricately woven together, defying the laws of gravity.\n\nIntrigued, Lily joined the crowd and marveled at the clock tower's remarkable design. She noticed that some gears meshed perfectly with others, rotating in perfect unison, while others seemed misaligned, causing the gears to grind and screech against each other.\n\nSuddenly, the village elder appeared, standing atop a makeshift wooden podium near the clock tower. He gestured for silence, and the crowd obediently hushed.\n\n\"Dear villagers,\" the elder began, his voice boomed across the square. \"Our beloved Numeria faces a grave predicament. The gears within our clock tower are faltering, causing time to halt and our lives to spiral into chaos.\"\n\nThe crowd gasped, their eyes widening with concern.\n\n\"But fear not!\" the elder continued. \"We have a ray of hope in our midst. Our own Lily, the renowned mathematician, shall solve this perplexing enigma we face.\"\n\nLily's heart skipped a beat. She had a propensity for puzzles, a passion for problems, and this was an opportunity like no other.\n\n\"Good people,\" she addressed the crowd, her voice steady yet filled with determination. \"I shall investigate this mechanism and restore the harmony of our time.\"\n\nEager to begin her quest, Lily swiftly climbed the staircase within the clock tower, reaching the top where gears of all sizes loomed before her. As she examined the intricate gears, she recalled the village elder's words about perfect meshing and the importance of ratios between their angular velocities.\n\nIn no time, a plan began to form in Lily's mind. She realized that the gears within the clock tower were indeed interconnected, much like the mathematical problem she had encountered before. It seemed that the gears were not meshing correctly, causing the clock to malfunction.\n\nWith her vast knowledge of mathematics, Lily deciphered the underlying patterns within the gears. Each one had a specific circumference, denoted by the integers c, s, p, and q \u2014 a language familiar to her. The gears also operated under certain conditions. For instance, they had to have a minimum of 5 teeth, and the circle within which the gears lay, denoted as C, had to be at least 1cm apart from the smaller circle, S.\n\nDriven by her passion for numbers and a desire to help her community, Lily delved deeper into the gears' secrets. She meticulously calculated the number of gear arrangements, making sure each gear meshed perfectly with the others. The gears must fit with precision, aligning their teeth and grooves perfectly, creating a harmonious rotation.\n\nAs she worked tirelessly inside the clock tower, Lily restored the gears to their optimal arrangement, mending the broken ratios and ensuring that the gears meshed flawlessly. Ultimately, the clock tower resumed its steady tick, and time once again flowed smoothly in Numeria.\n\nHowever, as the gears turned, a new question emerged in Lily's mind. Though the task at hand was complete, she pondered how many other possible gear arrangements existed for different values of c, s, p, and q. It fascinated her to think about the multitude of combinations and how they might impact the workings of a clock tower.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and those weeks transformed into months. Lily couldn't shake the problem from her thoughts. She knew she had to find the answer, and it tormented her not knowing how many different gear arrangements were possible, or what effects they might have.\n\nAnd so, dear reader, I leave you with this question \u2014 How many different gear arrangements, represented by g(c, s, p, q), are possible for the given values of c, s, p, and q, and how can we calculate G(500)?

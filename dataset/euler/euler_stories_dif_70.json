They were discussing a legendary treasure hidden deep within the enchanted forest, rumored to possess unimaginable power. In order to find this treasure, they needed to solve a mathematical problem involving triangles and ellipses. Intrigued, Ethan listened intently, his curiosity piqued.\n\nUnable to contain his excitement, Ethan interrupted the villagers, \"Tell me more about this mathematical problem! I am familiar with triangles and ellipses, perhaps I can be of assistance?\"\n\nHesitant at first, the villagers agreed to share the details of the problem with Ethan. As they explained the intricacies of the problem, Ethan's eyes widened with awe and wonder. He realized that solving this mathematical puzzle was the key to unlocking the location of the hidden treasure.\n\nDetermined to acquire this treasure, Ethan ventured forth into the depths of the enchanted forest. The trees whispered ancient secrets, and the air crackled with an otherworldly magic.

Etched onto the archway was a riddle:\n\n\"In the realm of triangles,\nwhere foci rest at \u221a13 measure,\nseek the treasure that lies within,\nusing the elliptical marvel's pleasure.\"\n\nUnderstanding that the mathematical problem held the key to solving the riddle, Ethan immersed himself in deep contemplation. He sketched diagrams, wrote equations, and tested different solutions. Finally, after days of tireless effort, he arrived at a breakthrough.\n\n\"I have it!\" Ethan exclaimed triumphantly. \"It's all about finding triangles with vertices having integer coordinates, while at the same time enclosing an ellipse with the given foci. I can do this!\"\n\nEthan's heart raced as he returned to his workshop and began forging a special tool. He carefully shaped a one-of-a-kind compass, designed to measure the necessary angles and distances. Equipped with this new instrument, he set out once again into the enchanted forest, determined to find the treasure.\n\nAs Ethan ventured deeper into the forest, the surroundings grew more mystical and enchanting. Glowing flowers illuminated the path, and ethereal music filled the air. Heerushed past beautiful canyons, over majestic waterfalls, and through dense thickets until he arrived at a serene clearing.\n\nIn the center of the clearing stood a magnificent stone pedestal, upon which rested a dazzling jewel. The jewel flickered with a mesmerizing light, emanating a powerful energy.

It was a wise and ancient mathematician, the guardian of the treasure. The spirit spoke in a voice that resonated with both wisdom and mystery.\n\n\"Ethan, you have journeyed far and solved the riddle. But tell me, what is the sum of the areas of all the triangles that enclose the ellipse with foci at (\u221a13, 0) and (-\u221a13, 0), and have vertices with integer coordinates less than or equal to n?\"\n\nEthan's heart sank. He had come so far, yet the final question remained unanswered. He knew that only by solving this mathematical problem would he be able to claim the treasure. Determined, he gathered all his knowledge, reasoning, and logical thinking to solve the problem.\n\nAs the villagers watched, Ethan pondered the ghostly mathematician's question. Each vertex held a secret, a hidden code that only the chevrons of ellipses could unlock. The solution seemed close, but the vastness of the problem overwhelmed him.\n\nWith a determined gleam in his eye, Ethan turned to the villagers and with unwavering resolve said, \"This is a challenge that transcends mere numbers and shapes. Together, we shall find the answer, for the power of community and shared knowledge can overcome any obstacle.\"\n\nAnd so, the village of Mathlandia, united by their desire to unlock the power within the legendary treasure, rallied behind Ethan.

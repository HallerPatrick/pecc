The one who takes the last pebble shall be crowned champion.\"\n\nJo's eyes widened with anticipation. \"That sounds marvelous, Siegbert! How many pebbles should we use?\"\n\nSiegbert, being the clever one, knew exactly how to make the game more exciting. \"Ah, Jo, let's make it challenging. We'll start with different numbers of pebbles each time. How about we use a heap of 17 pebbles for now?\"\n\nJo nodded eagerly, ready to accept the challenge. \"Alright, Siegbert, you start. How many pebbles will you take?\"\n\nSiegbert pondered for a moment, knowing that he could take all 17 pebbles on his first turn if he wanted to. However, he wanted to make the game more interesting for both of them. He wanted to find the smallest number of pebbles he could take that would still ensure his victory, assuming they both played optimally.\n\nAfter some careful calculations, Siegbert confidently picked up just one pebble. \"I'll take one pebble, Jo.\"\n\nJo frowned, puzzled by her brother's decision. She knew he could have taken more. \"Why only one, Siegbert? You could have taken up to 17!\"\n\nSiegbert smiled mischievously. \"Ah, Jo, the art of strategy lies not in taking all the pebbles in one go, but in choosing just enough to secure victory. Trust me. It's a mathematical marvel.\"\n\nEager to prove her own mathematical prowess, Jo took her turn and decided to take two pebbles. The game went back and forth, with Siegbert and Jo carefully calculating their moves to maximize their chances of success. The crowd watched on, captivated by their strategic choices.\n\nFinally, after several turns, Siegbert triumphantly plucked the last pebble from the heap, leaving Jo in awe. \"Congratulations, Siegbert! You've won!\" she exclaimed.\n\nSiegbert nodded, pleased with himself. \"Thank you, Jo. I may have won this time, but we should try with a different number of pebbles next. Let's see what happens when we start with 8 pebbles.\"\n\nExcitement filled the air as Siegbert and Jo continued their game, experimenting with different numbers of pebbles. Each time, Siegbert always managed to find the optimal strategy, taking the fewest number of pebbles that would guarantee his victory.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. During that time, the siblings played the pebble game countless times, the villagers always watching, cheering, and inspired by the wonders of mathematics. Siegbert's strategic decisions became legendary, and Mathlandia became known far and wide for the brilliance of its games.\n\nAs the people of Mathlandia marveled at Siegbert and Jo's expertise, they wondered about the sum of the minimal amounts Siegbert had chosen every time he played. They whispered amongst themselves, \"What could the sum be? How do all these minimal amounts add up?\"\n\nNow, dear reader, it is your time to embrace the spirit of Siegbert and Jo's mathematical marvels. I pose this question to you: What is the sum of these minimal amounts for all the numbers from 1 to 23416728348467685?\n\nLet your mathematical curiosity guide you on this grand quest."

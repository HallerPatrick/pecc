        "converted_description": "You are given an Intcode program represented as a list of integers. The program consists of opcodes and parameters. Opcodes indicate what operation to perform, and parameters indicate the addresses of the input and output values. The program starts at position 0 and executes instructions by moving the instruction pointer forward by 4 positions after each instruction. The opcodes 1 and 2 perform addition and multiplication operations respectively. The program halts when it encounters opcode 99. Before running the program, you need to replace position 1 with the value 12 and position 2 with the value 2. After the program halts, determine the value at position 0.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of comma-seperated integers representing the Intcode program."

        "converted_description": "Now, given the same Intcode program, find the pair of input values (noun and verb) that produce the output 19690720. The noun is the value placed in address 1, and the verb is the value placed in address 2. The input values for noun and verb are between 0 and 99, inclusive. Reset the computer's memory to the values in the program before trying each pair of inputs. Calculate the result as 100 * noun + verb.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of comma-seperated integers representing the Intcode program."

        "converted_description": "You are given an Intcode program that controls an emergency hull painting robot. The robot can move around a grid of square panels on the side of a ship, detect the color of the current panel, and paint it black or white. The robot starts on a black panel and follows the instructions given by the Intcode program. For each panel, the program outputs the color to paint the panel (0 for black, 1 for white) and the direction for the robot to turn (0 for left, 1 for right). After painting a panel, the robot moves forward one panel in the direction it is facing. The robot continues until it finishes painting. Calculate the number of panels that are painted at least once.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is an Intcode program represented as a comma-separated list of integers."

The identifier is always eight capital letters.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is an Intcode program represented as a comma-separated list of integers."

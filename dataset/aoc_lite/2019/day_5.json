        "converted_description": "You are given an Intcode program that represents a diagnostic program for a ship computer. The program contains instructions with different opcodes and parameter modes. Your task is to run the diagnostic program and determine the diagnostic code it produces. The diagnostic code is the output value after the program finishes. The program will request an input value of `1` and perform a series of tests to check the functionality of the Intcode computer. Each test will output a value indicating how far the result was from the expected value. Your goal is to find the final diagnostic code.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a comma-separated list of integers representing the Intcode program."

        "converted_description": "Now, you need to modify your Intcode computer to support additional opcodes. These opcodes include jump instructions and comparison instructions. You are given an updated diagnostic program that requires you to provide an input value of `5` as the ID for the ship's thermal radiator controller. The program will output a single number, which is the diagnostic code.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a comma-separated list of integers representing the Intcode program."

        "converted_description": "You are given an Intcode program that controls a drone system. The program takes in X and Y coordinates and outputs whether the drone is being pulled or not. Your task is to determine the number of points affected by the tractor beam in a given area. The tractor beam is represented by a grid and the drone control program will report `1` if the point is affected by the beam and `0` otherwise. For example, if you scan a 10x10 grid closest to the emitter, you need to count the number of points that are affected by the tractor beam.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a comma-seperated list representing the Intcode program that represents the drone control program."

        "converted_description": "You are given an Intcode program that controls a drone system. The program takes in X and Y coordinates and outputs whether the drone is being pulled or not. Your task is to find the coordinates of the top-left corner of a *100x100* square that fits entirely within the tractor beam. Within that square, you need to find the closest point to the emitter. Finally, compute the value by multiplying the X coordinate of the closest point by `10000` and adding the Y coordinate.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a comma-seperated list representing the Intcode program that represents the drone control program."

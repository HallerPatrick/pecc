        "converted_description": "You are given a deck of space cards numbered from 0 to 10006 in factory order. You need to perform a series of shuffling techniques on the deck and determine the position of card 2019 after shuffling.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a series of shuffling techniques represented as strings. Each string represents a technique and can be one of the following:\n1. \"deal into new stack\": Create a new stack of cards by dealing the top card of the deck onto the top of the new stack repeatedly until you run out of cards.\n2. \"cut N\": Take the top N cards off the top of the deck and move them as a single unit to the bottom of the deck, retaining their order.\n3. \"cut -N\": Take the bottom N cards off the bottom of the deck and move them as a single unit to the top of the deck, retaining their order.\n4. \"deal with increment N\": Deal the cards onto a table by incrementing the position by N each time, wrapping around if necessary. Finally, collect the cards on the table so that the leftmost card ends up at the top of the deck, the card to its right ends up just below the top card, and so on, until the rightmost card ends up at the bottom of the deck."

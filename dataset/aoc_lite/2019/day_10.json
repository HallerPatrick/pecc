        "converted_description": "You are given a map of an asteroid belt, represented by a grid of positions. Each position can either be empty (`.`) or contain an asteroid (`#`). Your task is to find the asteroid that can detect the largest number of other asteroids. An asteroid can detect another asteroid if there is no other asteroid exactly between them, regardless of the angle of the line of sight.\n\nWrite a function `findBestAsteroid(input: str) -> int` that takes in a string representing the map of the asteroid belt and returns the number of other asteroids that can be detected from the best location.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a  list of strings consisting of `.` and `#` characters representing an asteroid belt map. Each character represents a position in the grid."

        "converted_description": "After finding the best location for the monitoring station, you need to determine which asteroid will be vaporized as the 200th asteroid. The laser starts by pointing up and rotates clockwise, vaporizing any asteroid it hits. If multiple asteroids are in line with the station, only one can be vaporized before the laser continues rotating. The vaporization process continues until the 200th asteroid is vaporized.\n\nWrite a function `find200thVaporizedAsteroid(input: str) -> int` that takes in a string representing the map of the asteroid belt and returns the result of multiplying the X coordinate of the 200th vaporized asteroid by 100 and adding its Y coordinate.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of strings consisting of `.` and `#` characters representing an asteroid belt map. Each character represents a position in the grid."

        "converted_description": "You are given a rectangular screen that has a width of 50 pixels and a height of 6 pixels. The screen starts with all pixels turned off. The screen can be modified using three operations: \"rect AxB\" turns on all pixels in a rectangle at the top-left of the screen with width A and height B, \"rotate row y=A by B\" shifts all pixels in row A to the right by B positions, and \"rotate column x=A by B\" shifts all pixels in column A down by B positions. After applying a series of instructions to the screen, you need to determine how many pixels are turned on.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of a series of instructions for modifying the screen."

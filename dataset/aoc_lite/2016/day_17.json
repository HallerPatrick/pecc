Some doors are open and some are closed based on the MD5 hash of a passcode followed by a sequence of uppercase characters representing the path taken so far. The doors are represented by `U` for up, `D` for down, `L` for left, and `R` for right. The goal is to find the shortest path from the top-left room to the bottom-right room by following the open doors.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a string representing the passcode."

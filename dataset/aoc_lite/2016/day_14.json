        "converted_description": "You are given a salt and a specific algorithm to generate MD5 hashes. Your task is to find the index of the 64th key in the generated hashes. A hash is considered a key if it contains a sequence of three identical characters, and if one of the next 1000 hashes contains a sequence of five identical characters. To increase security, each hash needs to go through key stretching, which involves finding the MD5 hash of the previous hash a total of 2016 times.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a string representing the salt."

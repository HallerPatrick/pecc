A capsule is dropped and tries to fall through the slots in the rotating discs. If any of the slots aren't aligned with the capsule as it passes, the capsule bounces off the disc. The goal is to find the first time you can press the button to drop the capsule and have it fall through all the discs without bouncing off.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of discs, each described by its number, the number of positions it has, and its initial position at time=0. E.g. `Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.`"

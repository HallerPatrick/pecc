The program takes a value in register `a` and outputs a sequence of `0` and `1` as the clock signal. Find the lowest positive integer that can be used to initialize register `a` in order to produce a clock signal of `0`, `1`, `0`, `1`, ... repeating forever.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a series of instructions in assembly code."

You already have one star installed, so you need to find the number of additional stars needed to generate the desired signal.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is the same series of instructions in assembly code as in Part 1."

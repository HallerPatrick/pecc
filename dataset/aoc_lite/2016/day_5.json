        "converted_description": "You are given a Door ID, which is a string. The password for the door is generated one character at a time by finding the MD5 hash of the Door ID concatenated with an increasing integer index. The password character is determined by the sixth character of the hash if the hash starts with five zeroes. The password is generated by repeating this process until the password has eight characters. For example, if the Door ID is \"abc\", the password would be generated by finding the hashes of \"abc0\", \"abc1\", \"abc2\", and so on, until the password has eight characters.\n\nWhat is the password generated by the Door ID?\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a string representing the Door ID."

        "converted_description": "As the door slides open, you are presented with a second door that uses a different password generation mechanism. The hash still needs to start with five zeroes, but now the sixth character represents the position within the password to fill, and the seventh character is the character to put in that position. Only the first hash result for each position is considered, and any invalid positions are ignored.\n\nWhat is the password generated by the Door ID using this new mechanism?\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a string representing the Door ID."

The operations include swapping positions, swapping letters, rotating the string, reversing a span of letters, and moving a letter to a new position. Starting with the password `abcdefgh`, apply each operation in succession to the string. After all operations are applied, determine the resulting scrambled password.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of strings, each representing a scrambling operation. The operations can be one of the following:\n* `swap position X with position Y`\n* `swap letter X with letter Y`\n* `rotate left X steps`\n* `rotate right X steps`\n* `rotate based on position of letter X`\n* `reverse positions X through Y`\n* `move position X to position Y`\n\nConverted Challenge -"

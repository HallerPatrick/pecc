Santa can start and end at any two different locations. The distance between two locations is the same in both directions. \n\nFor example, given the following distances:\n\n```\nLondon to Dublin = 464\nLondon to Belfast = 518\nDublin to Belfast = 141\n```\n\nThe possible routes are:\n\n```\nDublin -> London -> Belfast = 982\nLondon -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605\nLondon -> Belfast -> Dublin = 659\nDublin -> Belfast -> London = 659\nBelfast -> Dublin -> London = 605\nBelfast -> London -> Dublin = 982\n```\n\nThe shortest of these routes is `London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605`, and so the answer is `605` in this example.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of distances between pairs of locations in the format `Location1 to Location2 = Distance`, separated by line breaks."

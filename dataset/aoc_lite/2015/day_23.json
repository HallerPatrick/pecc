        "converted_description": "You are given a program that operates on two registers, `a` and `b`, and a list of instructions. The registers are initially set to 0. The instructions are as follows:\n* `hlf r` - sets register `r` to half of its current value\n* `tpl r` - sets register `r` to triple its current value\n* `inc r` - increments register `r` by 1\n* `jmp offset` - jumps to the instruction `offset` away relative to itself\n* `jie r, offset` - jumps to the instruction `offset` away relative to itself if register `r` is even\n* `jio r, offset` - jumps to the instruction `offset` away relative to itself if register `r` is 1\n\nThe program terminates when it tries to run an instruction beyond the ones defined. What is the value in register `b` when the program finishes executing?\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of instructions, with one instruction per line."

        "converted_description": "You are given a set of instructions for turning lights on, off, or toggling their state in a 1000x1000 grid. Each instruction consists of a command (`turn on`, `turn off`, or `toggle`) and a range of coordinates representing opposite corners of a rectangle. Each coordinate pair refers to a square of lights.\n\nLights in the grid are initially turned off. Following the instructions, determine the total number of lights that are turned on.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of a series of instructions, each on a separate line. Each instruction is in the format `<command> <x1>,<y1> through <x2>,<y2>`, where `<command>` is one of `turn on`, `turn off`, or `toggle`, and `<x1>,<y1>` and `<x2>,<y2>` are the coordinate pairs representing opposite corners of a rectangle."

        "converted_description": "You are given the same set of instructions as in Part 1. However, in this case, the lights have individual brightness controls and can have a brightness of zero or more. The instructions specify how to modify the brightness of the lights.\n\nThe phrase `turn on` increases the brightness of the lights in the specified range by `1`. The phrase `turn off` decreases the brightness by `1`, to a minimum of zero. The phrase `toggle` increases the brightness by `2`.\n\nCalculate the total brightness of all lights combined after following the instructions.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of a series of instructions, each on a separate line. Each instruction is in the format `<command> <x1>,<y1> through <x2>,<y2>`, where `<command>` is one of `turn on`, `turn off`, or `toggle`, and `<x1>,<y1>` and `<x2>,<y2>` are the coordinate pairs representing opposite corners of a rectangle."

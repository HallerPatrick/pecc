        "converted_description": "Converted Challenge - \nYou are given a set of replacement rules and a medicine molecule. Each replacement rule is in the form of `A => B`, where `A` and `B` are strings. The rule means that any instance of string `A` in the medicine molecule can be replaced with string `B`. \n\nYour task is to determine the number of distinct molecules that can be generated after applying one replacement rule to the medicine molecule. A replacement can be applied to any instance of `A` in the molecule, and all possible replacements should be considered. \n\nFor example, given the following replacement rules:\n```\nH => HO\nH => OH\nO => HH\n```\nand the medicine molecule `HOH`, the possible generated molecules are:\n* `HOOH` (by replacing the first `H`)\n* `HOHO` (by replacing the second `H`)\n* `OHOH` (by replacing the first `H`)\n* `HOOH` (by replacing the second `H`)\n* `HHHH` (by replacing `O`)\n\nThere are a total of 4 distinct molecules that can be generated.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of replacement rules followed by a blank line, and then the medicine molecule. Each replacement rule is in the format `A => B`, where `A` and `B` are strings. The medicine molecule is a string."

        "converted_description": "Now, given the same set of replacement rules and the medicine molecule, determine the fewest number of steps required to transform the starting molecule `e` into the target medicine molecule. \n\nStarting with the molecule `e`, you can apply the replacement rules to generate new molecules. You can repeat this process until the target medicine molecule is obtained. \n\nFor example, given the following replacement rules:\n```\ne => H\ne => O\nH => HO\nH => OH\nO => HH\n```\nand the target medicine molecule `HOH`, the fewest number of steps required to transform `e` into `HOH` is 3. \n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of replacement rules followed by a blank line, and then the medicine molecule. Each replacement rule is in the format `A => B`, where `A` and `B` are strings. The medicine molecule is a string."

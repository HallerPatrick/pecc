        "converted_description": "You are given a blueprint for a Turing machine, which consists of a tape, a cursor, and a set of states. The tape is an infinite string of 0s, and the cursor can move left or right along the tape. Each slot on the tape can either contain a 0 or a 1. Based on the current value under the cursor and the current state, the Turing machine performs a set of actions: it writes a new value to the current position, moves the cursor left or right, and transitions to a new state. The Turing machine starts in a specified initial state and runs for a certain number of steps. After the specified number of steps, the Turing machine pauses, and the diagnostic checksum is calculated by counting the number of 1s on the tape. Your task is to recreate the Turing machine and determine the diagnostic checksum it produces.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a blueprint for a Turing machine. It consists of the following components:\n- The initial state\n- The number of steps to perform the diagnostic checksum\n- A set of states, each with rules for different conditions (current value and current state)"

        "converted_description": "After successfully recreating the Turing machine, you are prompted to deposit stars to increase your priority level. The number of stars required to increase the priority level is given, and you must deposit the stars to reach the required level. Your task is to calculate the number of stars required to reach the required priority level.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a message displayed on the console, indicating the number of stars required to increase the priority level."

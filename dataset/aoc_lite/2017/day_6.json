In each redistribution cycle, the bank with the most blocks is selected and its blocks are evenly distributed among the other banks, starting from the next bank. This process continues until a configuration is produced that has been seen before. You need to determine the number of redistribution cycles required to reach this state.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of integers representing the number of blocks in each memory bank. Each integer is separated by a tab character."

The goal is to build a bridge, starting with a port of type 0, that maximizes the strength of the bridge. The strength of a bridge is the sum of the pin numbers of all the connected ports. Find the strength of the strongest bridge you can build.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of components, where each component is represented as two integers separated by a '/'. The first integer represents the number of pins on one port, and the second integer represents the number of pins on the other port."

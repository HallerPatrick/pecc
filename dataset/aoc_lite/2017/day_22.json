        "converted_description": "You are given a grid computing cluster, represented by a 2-dimensional grid of clean and infected nodes. A virus carrier moves through the network, infecting or cleaning nodes as it moves. The virus carrier follows these rules:\n- If the current node is infected, it turns right. Otherwise, it turns left.\n- If the current node is clean, it becomes infected. Otherwise, it becomes cleaned.\n- The virus carrier moves forward one node in the direction it is facing.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of bursts of activity that cause a node to become infected after a certain number of bursts.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a grid representation of the cluster, where '.' represents a clean node and '#' represents an infected node."

The new rules are as follows:\n- If the current node is clean, it turns left.\n- If the current node is weakened, it does not turn and continues moving in the same direction.\n- If the current node is infected, it turns right.\n- If the current node is flagged, it reverses direction.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of bursts of activity that cause a node to become infected after a certain number of bursts.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a grid representation of the cluster, where '.' represents a clean node, '#' represents an infected node, 'W' represents a weakened node, and 'F' represents a flagged node."

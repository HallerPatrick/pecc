The internal timer of a lanternfish starts counting down after the current day. When the internal timer reaches 0, the lanternfish creates a new lanternfish with an internal timer of 8. On the next day, the internal timer of the new lanternfish starts counting down. Each day, a timer of 0 becomes 6 and adds an 8 to the end of the list, while each other timer decreases by 1. After a given number of days, you need to determine the total number of lanternfish.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a comma-seperated list of integers representing the internal timers of lanternfish."

        "converted_description": "You are given a hexadecimal-encoded BITS transmission, which contains packets with different types and versions. The transmission needs to be decoded by converting the hexadecimal representation into binary and interpreting the packets. Each packet has a header that includes the version and type ID. The transmission can contain literal value packets or operator packets. For literal value packets, the binary number is padded and broken into groups of four bits. For operator packets, the length of the sub-packets is indicated by the length type ID. The goal is to parse the hierarchy of packets and calculate the sum of all the version numbers.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a hexadecimal string representing the BITS transmission."

        "converted_description": "Now that the BITS transmission is decoded, you need to evaluate the expression represented by the transmission. The transmission includes literal value packets and different types of operator packets. Literal value packets represent a single number, while operator packets perform calculations on one or more sub-packets. The different types of operator packets include sum, product, minimum, maximum, greater than, less than, and equal to packets. The value of the outermost packet needs to be determined by applying the rules for each type of packet.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a hexadecimal string representing the BITS transmission."

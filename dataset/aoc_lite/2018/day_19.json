        "converted_description": "You are given a program that manipulates registers and an instruction pointer. The program consists of a series of instructions, each of which performs a specific operation on the registers. The instruction pointer indicates which instruction to execute next. The program terminates when the instruction pointer points to an instruction that is outside the bounds of the program.\n\nThe program starts with the instruction pointer set to 0 and the registers set to 0. Each instruction updates the values of the registers and the instruction pointer. After executing an instruction, the instruction pointer is incremented by 1.\n\nOne special instruction, `#ip n`, binds the instruction pointer to register n. This means that the value of register n will be written to the instruction pointer before each instruction is executed, and the value of register n will be updated with the value of the instruction pointer after each instruction finishes execution.\n\nAt the end of the program, what value is left in register 0?\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a series of lines, each representing an instruction. The first line is of the form `#ip n`, where n is an integer indicating the register to which the instruction pointer is bound. The subsequent lines represent instructions and follow the format `opcode a b c`, where opcode is a string indicating the operation to be performed, and a, b, and c are integers representing the registers on which the operation is performed."

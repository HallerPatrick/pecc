        "converted_description": "You are given a list of blueprints for constructing robots to collect resources. Each blueprint specifies the cost of each type of robot in terms of the resources it requires. You need to determine which blueprint will maximize the number of geodes that can be opened in 24 minutes. Each robot can collect 1 resource per minute, and it takes 1 minute to construct a robot.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of blueprints, where each blueprint is formatted as follows:\n- Each line contains the description of a blueprint.\n- Each blueprint specifies the cost of each type of robot, separated by commas.\n- The cost of each robot is specified as the number of resources it requires.\n- The blueprints are provided in the order they appear in the list. E.g. `Blueprint 1: Each ore robot costs 4 ore. Each clay robot costs 3 ore. Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 18 clay. Each geode robot costs 4 ore and 8 obsidian.`"

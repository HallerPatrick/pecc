        "converted_description": "You are given a configuration of stacks of crates and a series of rearrangement steps. Each step involves moving a quantity of crates from one stack to another. The crates are moved one at a time, and the order of the crates is preserved when moved. After the rearrangement process is complete, determine which crate ends up on top of each stack. For example:\n\n```\n    [D]    \n[N] [C]    \n[Z] [M] [P]\n 1   2   3\n\nmove 1 from 2 to 1\nmove 3 from 1 to 3\nmove 2 from 2 to 1\nmove 1 from 1 to 2\n\n```\n\nIn this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate `Z` is on the bottom, and crate `N` is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates `M`, `C`, and `D`. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, `P`.\n\nThen, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\n\n```\n[D]        \n[N] [C]    \n[Z] [M] [P]\n 1   2   3\n\n```\n\nIn the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved *one at a time*, so the first crate to be moved (`D`) ends up below the second and third crates:\n\n```\n        [Z]\n        [N]\n    [C] [D]\n    [M] [P]\n 1   2   3\n\n```\n\nThen, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved *one at a time*, crate `C` ends up below crate `M`:\n\n```\n        [Z]\n        [N]\n[M]     [D]\n[C]     [P]\n 1   2   3\n\n```\n\nFinally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:\n\n```\n        [Z]\n        [N]\n        [D]\n[C] [M] [P]\n 1   2   3\n\n```\n\nYou just need to know *which crate will end up on top of each stack*; in this example, the top crates are `C` in stack 1, `M` in stack 2, and `Z` in stack 3, so you should combine these together and return the message `*CMZ*`.\n\n*After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?*\n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of a series of lines representing the initial configuration of the stacks of crates (a crate is represented by `[<letter>]`, the absents of a crate is three whitespaces, all crates are whitespace seperated), followed by a series of lines representing the rearrangement steps. Each line contains a stack number (integer) and a crate letter (uppercase character) separated by a space. The stacks are numbered starting from 1."

        "converted_description": "You are given the same scenario as Part 1, but now the crane-mover has the ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once. When multiple crates are moved from one stack to another, the order of the crates is preserved.

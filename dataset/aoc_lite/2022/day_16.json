        "converted_description": "You are given a network of valves in a cave. Each valve has a flow rate and tunnels that lead to other valves. Your goal is to determine the maximum pressure that can be released within a given time frame. The time frame is defined as the number of minutes before a volcano erupts. \n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of valves with their flow rates and the tunnels that lead to other valves. Each valve is represented by a string in the format \"Valve X has flow rate=Y; tunnels lead to valves Z\" where X is the valve name, Y is the flow rate, and Z is a comma-separated list of valve names."

        "converted_description": "In addition to the previous challenge, you now have the option to teach an elephant to help you open valves. It takes 4 minutes to teach the elephant, leaving you with a reduced time frame for execution. You need to determine the maximum pressure that can be released within this new time frame.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is the same as Part 1."

Sensors can only lock on to the one beacon closest to the sensor as measured by the Manhattan distance. You need to determine the number of positions in a given row where a beacon cannot possibly exist.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of sensors and their closest beacons in the format `Sensor at x=<sensor_x>, y=<sensor_y>: closest beacon is at x=<beacon_x>, y=<beacon_y>`."

To determine its tuning frequency, multiply its x coordinate by 4000000 and add its y coordinate.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input is a list of sensors and their closest beacons in the format `Sensor at x=<sensor_x>, y=<sensor_y>: closest beacon is at x=<beacon_x>, y=<beacon_y>`."

The player with the higher-valued card wins the round and keeps both cards, placing them at the bottom of their own deck. If a player has all the cards, they win the game. Calculate the winning player's score, where the score is the sum of the card values multiplied by their position in the deck. \n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of two decks of cards represented as arrays of integers in the form `Player 1/2: score1, score2, ...`."

        "converted_description": "You lost to the small crab in the previous game, so you challenge it to a game of Recursive Combat. The game is similar to regular Combat, but with additional rules. If there was a previous round with the same cards in the same order, the game ends and player 1 wins. Otherwise, if both players have enough cards left, a new game of Recursive Combat is played. Each player creates a new deck by making a copy of the next cards in their deck, equal to the value of the card they drew. If one player does not have enough cards left, the winner of the round is determined by the higher-valued card. Calculate the winning player's score in Recursive Combat.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of two decks of cards represented as arrays of integers in the form `Player 1/2: score1, score2, ...`."

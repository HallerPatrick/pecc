Your task is to determine the encryption key that the devices use to communicate. To do this, you need to calculate the loop sizes for both devices and then use one device's loop size with the other device's public key to calculate the encryption key. The transformation process involves multiplying the value by the subject number and taking the remainder after dividing by `20201227`.\n\nInput Format:\nThe input consists of two integers representing the public keys of the devices seperated by newline."

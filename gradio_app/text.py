TITLE_TEXT = "PECC - Problem Extraction and Coding Challenges Evaluation Benchmark"

INTRODUCTION_TEXT = """ðŸ“„ PECC: An extensive benchmark centered on code generation from narrative-embedded problem descriptions. Unlike prior benchmarks that evaluate code generation using specific instructions, our dataset requires models to comprehend, extract requirements, and produce the essential code for problem-solving. This approach necessitates syntactically accurate programs and demands reading comprehension skills to derive the desired solution."""

TASK_DESCRIPTION = """## Task Description
The task for the model is to generate directly executable python code.

### Instruction
The model is first prompted with a system prompt, which is a short description of the problem. The model is then asked to generate the python code that solves the problem.

### Task 
The model receives the task itself.
